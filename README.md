# Open_Addressing_HashMap
A chained hash table that  (1) Automatically expands and contracts (by a factor of 2), and (2) Recalls the insertion order of its elements     Terminology:       number_of_buckets: the number of buckets/entries/chains in the hash table. It determines the range of legal table indices in the implementation. It changes during resizing. size: the number of elements the client has added, and not yet             removed, from the table       load_factor: ratio of size to number_of_buckets       load_limit: specifies a range outside of which the table is too                   full or empty. When load_factor reaches load_limit, the                   number_of_buckets is doubled. When it gets under (1-load_limit),                   the number_of_buckets is cut in half.     Notes:       No hash table with a number of buckets less than MIN_BUCKETS       is ever created, regardless of other parts of this specification. This is a hash-based set, not map, so there are only keys, not values.
